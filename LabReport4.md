Lab Report task: Do steps 4-9 listed in the lab write up and provide screenshots and the keys used to produce complete the step 

**Step One: Log into ieng6

I had previously logged into my ieng6 account, therefore instead of typing out "ssh cs15lsp23jw@ieng6" I was able to type this instead:

```
<up> <up> <up> <enter>
```
Output:

The up command allowed me to go through my history and retrieve the input from the last time I logged into my ieng6 account. This saved a lot of time, and rather 
than spending all the extra time trying to type out ssh and my account, I was able do so with only a few up arrow commands. 

**Step Two: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

In order to clone the fork of the repository from my github account I typed out: 

```
<g> <i> <t> <space> <c> <l> <o> <n> <e> <Command-C> the github I wanted to clone <Command-V> to paste it into my terminal <enter> 
```
The Command-C and Command-V allowed me to paste the link of the repository I wanted to copy faster and easier. Rather than using my mouse I was able to quickly used these commands 
and complete my tasks in a fast manner. 

**Step Three: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

I knew I had previously ran the tests, therefore it was somewhere in my history. With this understanding, I clicked these keys: 

```
<up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <enter>
```

**Step Four: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
