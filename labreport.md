Listed below is a step by step guide on how to log into a course specific account on **ieng6**!

### Step One: Installing VScode
If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed yet, open [VsCodeLink](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions provided.
The website should look like this!

Note: Theres a dropdown if your device is not a mac

Once installed, open Visual Code Studio. The homepage should look similar to this:

**Congrats! You completed step 1**

### Step Two: Remotely Connecting 
Now that you have Visual Studio Code installed, you want to use the terminal to connect with a remote computer! In this case, we're trying to log in with a course specific account with ieng6.
Note: ignore the next few lines if you have a Mac, only complete the next two steps if you're on Windows!
* Install git 
* open a terminal in Vs Code and open a new terminal 

FOR MAC:
* github should be installed already to check write git to terminal 
The output of this should be:

** Note: steps below are the same regardless of Mac or Windows! **
* write: ssh cs15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu ->replace xx corresponding to your personal account
You should then be prompted to answer a yes/no question ** reply with yes! **
Then type in your password 
At this point your terminal should look like this 
** Note the structure should be the same but my account is my email rather than my username due to some issues **
